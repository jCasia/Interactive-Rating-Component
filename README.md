## Hello Again! ðŸ‘‹

This was a very nice practice with the DOM, it took a while for me to code the 40 lines of JavaScript but I got there in the endðŸ˜‚
I added an extra feature using a little bit of gsap where if no number is selected, a message would appear on the top right corner of the card.

### Overview - Interactive Rating Component

- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### I coded this challenge using:
